Machine Learning A-Z Hands-On Python & R In Data Science

## Datasets
For datasets for this course [link](https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/machine-learning).

## Part 0: Presrequisites
- P-value
- Residuals
- R-Squared 
- Adj R-Square
- mean 
- median 
- likelihood
- Normalization
- Standardrization
- Confusion Matrix
- Feature Scaling-> For those algo. who apply euclidean distance method
- Naive base algorithm assumption -> All variables are independant including X & Y.
- False Positive: 
> Predict positive outcome but it's false.
- False Negative:
> Predict negative outcome ut it was false.
- Accuracy Paradox
- Cummulative Accuracy Curve(CAP)
- Elbow method
- Kmeans++

## Part 1: Data Processing
- Handling missing data
- Catagoraical data
> By using independant dummy variable alphabatically with binary fixtures.
- Featur Scalling 
> By Standardization OR Normalization to resist biasing of high or lower values as Machine Learning use Euclidean Distance Formula.
